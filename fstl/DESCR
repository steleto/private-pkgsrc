fstl is a viewer for .stl files.

It is optimized to quickly load and render very high-polygon models.

The Porsche model below is two million triangles. On my mid-range
laptop, this model loads in one second and renders at a smooth 60+
frames per second.

For comparison, Meshlab takes several seconds to load and renders at
about 15 frames per second. More sophisticated software has an even
larger overhead -- blender took about 12 seconds and locked up while
loading.

fstl isn't just fast -- it's also attractive. Models are rendered with
per-face flat shading and anti-aliasing in a smooth color scheme
reminiscent of Solarized.

Finally, fstl is cross-platform and open-source. Precompiled binaries
are available for Windows and Mac, and the only dependancy is Qt if
you want to build it yourself.

As always, the source is available on Github.
