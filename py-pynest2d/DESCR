This repository contains CPython bindings for libnest2d
(https://github.com/tamasmeszaros/libnest2d), a library to pack 2D
polygons into a small space. Libnest2d implements the 2D bin packing
problem.

The objective of this repository is to allow libnest2d to be called
from Python using Numpy. There is a competing solution
(https://github.com/markfink/nest2D) to provide Python bindings to
this end. However this solution is licensed under AGPL. Since Cura
(https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura) uses an LGPL license, it could not
use that solution. This implementation is also too limited for Cura's
purposes, so a new bindings project was set up that allows more
configuration of the nesting algorithm.
