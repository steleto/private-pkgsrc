Libnest2D is a library and framework for the 2D bin packaging problem.
Inspired from the SVGNest(svgnest.com) Javascript library the
project is built from scratch in C++11. The library is written with a
policy that it should be usable out of the box with a very simple
interface but has to be customizable to the very core as well. The
algorithms are defined in a header only fashion with templated
geometry types. These geometries can have custom or already existing
implementation to avoid copying or having unnecessary dependencies.
